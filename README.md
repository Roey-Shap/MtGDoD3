DoD3 - Custom MtG Set 1
= 
This is a custom MtG set created with **[ChickenSnake](https://github.com/Roey-Shap/ChickenSnake)**.
<br>
It's meant for limited play and focuses on the fundamental mechanic of **creature combat**.

That is to say, most of this experiments with the typical damage-tank-support trifecta.
<br>
I also wanted to try including what I believe to be the fourth main role - "information": this is also an **information matters** set. Revealed cards from your hand play a prominant role!
<br>
The main returning keywords mostly faciliate basic creatures-and-lands play: Backup, Bestow, Landfall, Adapt, Exploit. 

Set Focuses
=
So there are two focuses for each color pair:
1. How many creatures does it like to have at any given time?
1. How much information does it like to have revealed?

Each color has its basics that combine as seen later:
<br>âšª Leads towards larger team size. Exposes opponent information and detains cards directly from hand. 
<br>ðŸ”µ Adaptive team size. Buffs its effects the more it knows your secrets and easily reconceals its own.
<br>âš« Tends to have few creatures or even only one. Punishes foes for revealing its secrets and having theirs exposed. 
<br>ðŸ”´ Doesn't mind having many creatures. Bravely exposes its own information for buffs - sometimes forces opponents to do the same or get burned.
<br>ðŸŸ¢ Likes having many creatures. Honestly reveals information for ramp and buffing.

New Mechanics
=
Some deal with the combat-flow and how many creatures you have, others with how much information you reveal to your opponent.
<br>
Keep in mind that in this set 'reveal from your hand' means revealing an *unrevealed* card. It's an exhaustive resource!
1. Transparent *(Reveal this card as it's put into your hand.)*
1. Pop-up [cost] *(You may cast this card for [cost] as it's revealed from your hand.)*
1. Duck *(Tap, target creature you control with toughness greater than this one: this creature is considered "ducking" behind it until end of turn.)*
1. Horde N *(A general term like landfall for number of creatures. Get [effect] if you control/attack with N or more creatures.)*

Those were the main ones. Here are some more!
1. Grave Horde N *(Like Horde but for creatures in your graveyard.)*
1. Flicker *(Exiles a permanent, then immediately returns it to the battlefield.)*
1. Rivalstorm *(Copy this spell for each spell an opponent has cast this turn.)*

Revealing Cards - Mechanically, Flavorfully
=
Revealed cards give the opponent information. Right away this allows us to buff some cards to compensate for information lost. Sometimes we can augment them with "built-in" counterspells. This makes our opponent question our plan in a new way. It can also be really dumb :)

<br>Transparency can take on a few different connotations flavor-wise, too. For red and green it's often blunt honesty, bravery, or excitement. Blue lays your thoughts and memories out. For white it might be truth or evidence.

Pop-up
=
Revealing cards is also an outlet to trigger certain effects. Chief among them is *Pop-up* - it's the reveal analog to Madness. Whenever you reveal a card with Pop-up, you can cast it for its Pop-up cost. To me this interestingly conveys surprise, eagerness, and spontaneity:

<br>

Duck
=
I also wanted a mechanic that felt tangible and physical. Creatures can run for cover behind others, often assisting them from behind:
