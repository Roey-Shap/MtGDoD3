DoD3 - Custom MtG Set 1
= 
This is a custom MtG set created with **[ChickenSnake](https://github.com/Roey-Shap/ChickenSnake)**.
<br>
It's meant to be a simple set for limited play that focuses on the fundamental mechanic of **creature combat**.
<br>
That is to say, most of what I'm experimenting with here is how to manipulate the board state during combat in interesting ways. So think typical damage-tank-support trifecta.
<br>
That said, I also wanted to try including what I believe to be the fourth main role - "information". This is also an **information matters** set, with revealed cards from your hand playing a prominant role!
<br>
The main returning keywords and abilities:
1. Backup
1. Spree
1. Bestow
1. Ninjutsu

Some familiar honorable mentions:
1. Adapt
1. Landfall
1. Exploit

New Mechanics
=
As you can see, most of those were just about buffing or moving permanents around, especially for combat. Just emphasizing basic MtG-play. 
<br>
That said, there are some newcomers. Some deal with the combat-flow and how many creatures you have, others with how much information you reveal to your opponent. Some both! 
<br>
Keep in mind that in this set 'reveal from your hand' means revealing an *unrevealed* card. It's an exhaustive resource!
1. Transparent *(Reveal this card as it's put into your hand.)*
1. Pop-up [cost] *(You may cast this card for [cost] as it's revealed from your hand or library.)*
1. Duck *(Tap, target creature you control with toughness greater than this one: this creature is considered "ducking" behind it until end of turn.)*
1. Horde N *(A general term like landfall for number of creatures. Get [effect] if you control/attack with N or more creatures.)*

Those were the main ones. Here are some more!
1. Flicker *(Exiles a permanent, then immediately returns it to the battlefield.)*
1. Rivalstorm *(Copy this spell for each spell an opponent has cast this turn.)*
1. Grave Horde N *(Like Horde but for creatures in your graveyard.)*

Archetypes
=
So there are two focuses for each color pair:
1. How many creatures does it like to have at any given time?
1. How much information does it like to have revealed?

<br>ðŸ”µâšª U/W -- Wide variety of team size. Likes to reveal your secrets - for justice!
<br>âšªâš« W/B -- Mostly fewer creatures. Punishes you for holding secrets and exposing theirs.
<br>âš«ðŸ”µ B/U -- Team size netural. Often changes with bounce/ninjutsu. Revealing your information, holding onto theirs with strategic revealing/reconcealment.
<br>ðŸ”µðŸ”´ U/R -- Also relatively fluid team-size. Brazen! Punishes you for being stingy with secrets and gets bonuses for having an open heart.
<br>ðŸ”´âš« R/B -- Few/single creature/s. Let everyone see what we all hide! CHAOS!
<br>âš«ðŸŸ¢ B/G -- Doesn't mind how many creatures; tends towards fewer. Has some brave self-exposing for buffs.
<br>ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ G/R -- Likes to have lots of creatures but manages with a few. Often exposes its spells for massive buffs. Sometimes encourages opponent for to join the fun.

<br>ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ G/U -- Already benefits at pairs of 2 creatures; fluid if needed. Exposes own secrets sometimes.
